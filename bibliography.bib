@ARTICLE{Koomey2011-fc,
  title    = "Implications of Historical Trends in the Electrical Efficiency of
              Computing",
  author   = "Koomey, J G and Berard, S and Sanchez, M and Wong, H",
  abstract = "The electrical efficiency of computation has doubled roughly
              every year and a half for more than six decades, a pace of change
              comparable to that for computer performance and electrical
              efficiency in the microprocessor era. These efficiency
              improvements enabled the creation of laptops, smart phones,
              wireless sensors, and other mobile computing devices, with many
              more such innovations yet to come. The Web Extra appendix
              outlines the data and methods used in this study.",
