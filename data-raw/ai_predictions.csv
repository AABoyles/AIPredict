[...] Given its long-term price decline of roughly a factor of ten every five years, the cost of 4 * 10^16 bytes of memory will be in the $20 million range within thirty years, so that the time at which we might expect to build a computer with the potential to match human intelligence would be around the year 2017. As suggested earlier, however, building the hardware may be the easiest part; the need to untangle the mysteries of the structure and functioning of the mind, to gather the knowledge both innate and learned, and to engineer the software for the entire system will probably require time that goes well beyond 2017. Once we have a piece of hardware with brain-level power and appropriate a priori structure, it still might take as long as the twenty years humans require to reach adult-level mental competence!

Since computer capacity doubles every two years or so, we expect that in about 40 years, the computers will be as powerful as human brains. And two years after that, they will be twice as powerful, etc.  And computer production is not limited by the rate of human reproduction. So the total amount of brain-power available, counting humans plus computers, takes a rapid jump upward in 40 years or so.  40 years from now is 2035 AD.0"

There is no direct reason to suppose that Moore's law will not hold longer than 15 years. It thus seems likely that the requisite hardware for human-level artificial intelligence will be assembled in the first quarter of the next century, possibly within the first few years.

Software (including AI) isevolving rapidly, the cost of computers continues to drop, and alternatives to silicontransistors are promising to extend the changing trends into new media. These technologiescan augment the intelligence of the human species, both in speed and quality.If we attempt to extrapolate these trends a few decades into the future, we mayanticipate more than just machines that perfectly imitate human appearance andcognition. We may also expect organism-like machines that extend biological evolutioninto the nonbiological domains of silicon, nano-tubes, and other materials, machinesthat in some respects may grow superior to us cognitively, and possibly the fusion ofourselves with our machines. We may expect to experience direct neural interfacingwith our computers, and to be network interfaced with other individuals into supergroups that operate as single identities. Human individuals may be scanned, digitized and exist in the Web alone or rapidly evolve into lifelike robots. What would we becomeand what the world will turn into will depend on key actions taken before the changeaccelerates beyond our control. [...] We may possibly find in a mere 20 years or so that the fiction of robotshas actually transformed into the true evolutionary progeny of the human species."

That’s just plain nuts.  Let me try to explain just how nuts: 10^20 is about the number of neurons in all human brains combined.  It is also about the estimated number of grains of sand on all the beaches in the world.  That’s a truly insane number of calculations in 1 second. [...]  Conclusion: computer power is unlikely to be the issue anymore in terms of AGI being possible.  The main question is whether we can find the right algorithms.  Of course, with more computer power we have a more powerful tool with which to hunt for the right algorithms and it also allows any algorithms we find to be less efficient.  Thus growth in computer power will continue to be an important factor. [...]  Having dealt with computation, now we get to the algorithm side of things.  One of the big things influencing me this year has been learning about how much we understand about how the brain works, in particular, how much we know that should be of interest to AGI designers.  I won’t get into it all here, but suffice to say that just a brief outline of all this information would be a 20 page journal paper (there is currently a suggestion that I write such a paper next year with some Gatsby Unit neuroscientists, but for the time being I’ve got too many other things to attend to).  At a high level what we are seeing in the brain is a fairly sensible looking AGI design.  You’ve got hierarchical temporal abstraction formed for perception and action combined with more precise timing motor control, with an underlying system for reinforcement learning.  The reinforcement learning system is essentially a type of temporal difference learning though unfortunately at the moment there is evidence in favour of actor-critic, Q-learning and also Sarsa type mechanisms — this picture should clear up in the next year or so.  The system contains a long list of features that you might expect to see in a sophisticated reinforcement learner such as pseudo rewards for informative queues, inverse reward computations, uncertainty and environmental change modelling, dual model based and model free modes of operation, things to monitor context, it even seems to have mechanisms that reward the development of conceptual knowledge.  When I ask leading experts in the field whether we will understand reinforcement learning in the human brain within ten years, the answer I get back is “yes, in fact we already have a pretty good idea how it works and our knowledge is developing rapidly.”  The really tough nut to crack will be how the cortical system works. There is a lot of effort going into this, but based on what I’ve seen, it’s hard to say just how much real progress is being made.  From the experimental neuroscience side of things we will soon have much more detailed wiring information, though this information by itself is not all that enlightening.  What would be more useful is to be able to observe the cortex in action and at the moment our ability to do this is limited.  Moreover, even if we could, we would still most likely have a major challenge ahead of us to try to come up with a useful conceptual understanding of what is going on.  Thus I suspect that for the next 5 years, and probably longer, neuroscientists working on understanding cortex aren’t going to be of much use to AGI efforts.  My guess is that sometime in the next 10 years developments in deep belief networks, temporal graphical models, liquid computation models, slow feature analysis etc. will produce sufficiently powerful hierarchical temporal generative models to essentially fill the role of cortex within an AGI.  I hope to spend most of next year looking at this so in my next yearly update I should have a clearer picture of how things are progressing in this area.  Right, so my prediction for the last 10 years has been for roughly human level AGI in the year 2025 (though I also predict that sceptics will deny that it’s happened when it does!)  This year I’ve tried to come up with something a bit more precise.  In doing so what I’ve found is that while my mode is about 2025, my expected value is actually a bit higher at 2028.  This is not because I’ve become more pessimistic during the year, rather it’s because this time I’ve tried to quantify my beliefs more systematically and found that the probability I assign between 2030 and 2040 drags the expectation up.  Perhaps more useful is my 90% credibility region, which from my current belief distribution comes out at 2018 to 2036."

just concentrate on the 90%.  The question is a common one, but in my opinion
history will not answer it in this form.  Machines do not develop in direct
competition of human capabilities, but rather in attempts to enhance and
complement them.  If they still become better at certain tasks, this is a side
effect.  But as a side effect, it will indeed happen that more and more tasks
that we proudly claim to be creative in a human way, will be taken over by
computer systems.  Given that the promise of artificial intelligence is by now
50 years old, I am very cautious with numbers, and will say that at least 80
more years are needed before jokes about the stupidity of machines will become
outdated.

We will see natural language and speech becoming ubiquitous so we can communicate with devices (more than Siri) in the next 5-10 years. But I don’t see the development of autonomous HLMI coming anytime soon (such as robots in the movies – Data for example). There are many technical hurdles but there are also economic, political, and social issues.
