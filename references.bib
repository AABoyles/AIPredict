                 vertebrates. Primates, elephants and cetaceans are assumed to
                 be more intelligent than 'lower' mammals, the great apes and
                 humans more than monkeys, and humans more than the great apes.
                 Brain properties assumed to be relevant for intelligence are
                 the (absolute or relative) size of the brain, cortex,
                 prefrontal cortex and degree of encephalization. However,
                 factors that correlate better with intelligence are the number
                 of cortical neurons and conduction velocity, as the basis for
                 information-processing capacity. Humans have more cortical
                 neurons than other mammals, although only marginally more than
                 whales and elephants. The outstanding intelligence of humans
                 appears to result from a combination and enhancement of
                 properties found in non-human primates, such as theory of
                 mind, imitation and language, rather than from 'unique'

  abstract    = "The high energetic costs of human brain development have been
                 hypothesized to explain distinctive human traits, including
                 exceptionally slow and protracted preadult growth. Although
                 widely assumed to constrain life-history evolution, the
                 metabolic requirements of the growing human brain are unknown.
                 We combined previously collected PET and MRI data to calculate
                 the human brain's glucose use from birth to adulthood, which
                 we compare with body growth rate. We evaluate the strength of
                 brain-body metabolic trade-offs using the ratios of brain
                 glucose uptake to the body's resting metabolic rate (RMR) and
                 daily energy requirements (DER) expressed in glucose-gram
                 equivalents (glucosermr\% and glucoseder\%). We find that
                 glucosermr\% and glucoseder\% do not peak at birth (52.5\% and
                 59.8\% of RMR, or 35.4\% and 38.7\% of DER, for males and
                 females, respectively), when relative brain size is largest,
                 but rather in childhood (66.3\% and 65.0\% of RMR and 43.3\%
                 and 43.8\% of DER). Body-weight growth (dw/dt) and both
                 glucosermr\% and glucoseder\% are strongly, inversely related:
                 soon after birth, increases in brain glucose demand are
                 accompanied by proportionate decreases in dw/dt. Ages of peak
                 brain glucose demand and lowest dw/dt co-occur and subsequent
                 developmental declines in brain metabolism are matched by
                 proportionate increases in dw/dt until puberty. The finding
                 that human brain glucose demands peak during childhood, and
                 evidence that brain metabolism and body growth rate covary
                 inversely across development, support the hypothesis that the
                 high costs of human brain development require compensatory
                 slowing of body growth rate.",

                 energetics is an issue in the maintenance of a relatively
                 large brain, and that brain size is positively correlated with
                 the BMR in mammals, controlling for body size effects. We

                 primate brains differ from rodent brains in their cellular
                 composition. Here we examine the cellular scaling rules for
                 primate brains and show that brain size increases
                 approximately isometrically as a function of cell numbers,
                 such that an 11x larger brain is built with 10x more neurons
                 and approximately 12x more nonneuronal cells of relatively
                 constant average size. This isometric function is in contrast
                 to rodent brains, which increase faster in size than in
                 numbers of neurons. As a consequence of the linear cellular

  abstract = "This paper develops and assesses a broad functional category
              approach to arriving at metrics for assessing technological
              progress. The approach is applied to three functional categories
              of information technology --- storage, transportation and
              transformation by first building a 100 plus year database for
              each of the three functional categories. The results indicate
              generally continuous progress for each functional category
              independent of the specific underlying technological artifacts
              dominating at different times. Thus, the empirical results
              reported in this study indicate that the functional category
              approach offers a more stable and reliable methodology for
              assessing longer time technological progress trends. Therefore,
              this approach offers the promise of being more useful in
              technological forecasting for large-scale change even as its
              ability to forecast specific dominant technological trajectories
